				Rendering using Ray Tracing
			</h2>

			In Ray Tracer assignment, we created a ray tracing based renderer in C++ and created following scene.
			<p>
				<img src="Images/original_scene.jpg"></img>
			</p>
			<h3>Translated Scene</h3>
			In this assignment, we took the scene file for this scene and converted it to a RIB file and generated the following image in Renderman.

				<img src="Images/translated_scene.jpg"></img>
			</p>

			<h3>Indirect Illumination</h3>
			After adding indirect illumination to the scene, we got the following result.
