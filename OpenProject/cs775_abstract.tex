\section{Introduction}
Use this template to write your paper abstract and produce a pdf using
pdflatex.

Introduce the problem solved in the paper in the first section and
describe why is it interesting.

\section{Problem Scope}
Talk about the scope of the problem here.

\section{Solution}
Summarize the solution here - you can stretch your description to
maximum to one page (both sides of a A4 sheet).

\section{Important}
Learn to use bibtex and how to include citations/references your
document. Everybody should at least have one reference - of the paper
you are presenting. You may include more if you refer to them in your
text.

The \textbf{MOST} important aspect of writing this abstract is writing
it in your own words - do NOT copy verbatim from the paper. 

Please write whatever you understand. You are also free to write about
things in the paper that you think are interesting, difficult, not
easy to understand or implement. Try to think about what you have
learnt in graphics so far and place the paper in that context. ~\cite{2011-TOG-quadruped}
